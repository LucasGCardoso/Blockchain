# Blockchain
This repo is a study about blockchain, following a Blockchain Engineer course on Udemy.

## How to Run:
- Install the requirements on your workspace or in a Conda Env.
- Run each node on a separate unique CMD.
- Use your browser, or an API platform, such as Postman or Insomnia, to execute the requests. Open a separte tab for each node as well.
- Enjoy! :)


## Possible Future Improvements:
- Add pools, since the nodes can only mine their own sent transactions.
- Add interface for the nodes, for better UX.
- Add timer to keep searching for bigger chain to replace, since the user is not supposed to call this request.
- Improve the Consensus Protocol. Add complexity.
- Add more complex format checks for the blocks to be added.
